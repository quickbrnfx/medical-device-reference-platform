# UN-002 Capability Review

**Artifact ID:** REVIEW-CAPABILITY-002

**Status:** Draft

---

# Engineering Question

> Has User Need UN-002 been decomposed into a complete, non-overlapping, and implementation-independent set of engineering Capability Areas?

---

# Objective

The Capability Review validates the engineering capability decomposition for User Need UN-002 before functional requirements are derived.

This review ensures the proposed Capability Areas completely satisfy the User Need, remain implementation independent, and provide an appropriate basis for requirements development.

This review does not derive requirements or prescribe implementation decisions.

---

# Review Context

Capability Reviews are performed before functional requirements are developed.

Approval of this review establishes the Capability Area baseline for the associated User Need and authorizes functional requirements derivation.

---

# User Need

| ID | Description |
|----|-------------|
| **UN-002** | The patient needs their physiological information to remain protected throughout monitoring. |

---

# Proposed Capability Areas

| ID | Capability Area | Purpose |
|----|-----------------|---------|
| **CA-008** | Manage Access to Physiological Information | Ensure physiological information is made available only to authorized entities throughout monitoring. |
| **CA-009** | Maintain Physiological Information Confidentiality | Prevent unauthorized disclosure of physiological information throughout monitoring. |
| **CA-010** | Maintain Physiological Information Integrity | Prevent unauthorized modification of physiological information throughout monitoring. |

# Review Checklist

## 1. User Need Coverage

### Acceptance Criteria

- Every Capability Area contributes directly to UN-002.
- Collectively, the Capability Areas satisfy the complete User Need.
- No aspect of the User Need remains unallocated.

### Result

☐ Pass

☐ Fail

## 2. Capability Independence

### Acceptance Criteria

- Each Capability Area represents a distinct engineering responsibility.
- Capability Areas do not overlap.
- Responsibilities are clearly separated.

### Result

☐ Pass

☐ Fail

### Comments

---

## 3. Implementation Independence

### Acceptance Criteria

- Capability Areas describe engineering responsibilities.
- Capability Areas do not prescribe implementation mechanisms.
- Capability Areas remain technology independent.

Examples of implementation decisions include:

- Authentication methods
- Encryption algorithms
- Communication protocols
- Software architecture
- Security technologies

These implementation decisions are intentionally excluded from Capability Areas.

### Result

☐ Pass

☐ Fail

### Comments

## 4. Engineering Responsibility

### Acceptance Criteria

- Each Capability Area answers a distinct engineering question.
- Each Capability Area represents a system responsibility.
- Each Capability Area is independently allocatable and verifiable.

### Result

☐ Pass

☐ Fail

### Comments

---

## 5. Information Lifecycle Coverage

### Acceptance Criteria

The Capability Areas collectively protect physiological information throughout monitoring, including:

- Information creation
- Information access
- Information presentation
- Information storage
- Information communication
- Information retention
- Session completion

### Result

☐ Pass

☐ Fail
